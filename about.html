        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in front-end technologies. My journey into coding started when I was fascinated by how websites are built and function. Since then, I've dedicated myself to learning and mastering the skills necessary to create dynamic and user-friendly web applications.</p>
        
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>I graduated with a degree in Computer Science, where I gained a solid understanding of programming fundamentals and software development principles. During my studies, I completed several projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge practically, including a personal blog and an e-commerce website.</p>

        <h3>Skills & Interests</h3>
        <p>My technical skills include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTML & CSS:</strong> Proficient in creating responsive and accessible web layouts.</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript:</strong> Experienced in using JavaScript to enhance user interaction and create dynamic content.</li>
            <li><strong>React:</strong> Familiar with building modern web applications using React and its ecosystem.</li>
            <li><strong>Node.js:</strong> Knowledgeable in server-side development using Node.js and Express.</li>
            <li><strong>Git & GitHub:</strong> Comfortable with version control systems to manage and collaborate on projects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Playing video games and exploring new technologies.</li>
            <li>Reading books, particularly in the science fiction and technology genres.</li>
            <li>Hiking and spending time in nature to recharge and find inspiration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>My Vision</h3>
        <p>As a developer, my goal is to build applications that not only look good but also provide a seamless user experience. I believe in the importance of accessibility and strive to ensure that my projects are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.</p>

        <p>Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills, so I welcome any opportunities for collaboration or mentorship. Feel free to reach out!</p>
